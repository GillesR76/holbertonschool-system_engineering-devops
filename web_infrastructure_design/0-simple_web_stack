--> Issues with a simple web infrastructure:

- Single Point of Failure (SPOF): In a simple web infrastructure, there's often a single server handling all incoming requests. 
If this server fails due to hardware issues, software errors, or any other reason, the entire website or service becomes unavailable. 
This single point of failure can lead to significant downtime and loss of business.

- Downtime during Maintenance: When maintenance tasks such as deploying new code or applying updates are required, the web server often 
needs to be restarted. During this downtime, the website or service becomes inaccessible to users, leading to potential loss of revenue 
and frustration among users who rely on the service.

- Limited Scalability: Simple web infrastructures typically lack scalability features such as auto-scaling or load balancing. As a result, 
if the incoming traffic exceeds the capacity of the infrastructure, the website may become slow or unresponsive, or it may even crash under 
the load. This inability to scale effectively can hinder growth and limit the potential of the website or service.

--> What is a server:
A server is a computer or a software system that provides services or resources to other computers, known as clients, over a network. Servers 
are designed to handle specific tasks such as storing and delivering files, hosting websites, managing network resources, processing requests, 
and more. In the context of web infrastructure, a server typically refers to a computer system that hosts websites or web applications and 
responds to requests from clients (such as web browsers) over the internet.

--> Role of the Domain Name:
A domain name is a human-readable address that serves as a unique identifier for a website or web service on the internet. It provides a more 
user-friendly way to access resources hosted on servers, instead of using numerical IP addresses. The role of a domain name is to provide a 
memorable and recognizable name that users can type into their web browsers to access a specific website or service.

Type of DNS Record for www.foobar.com:
The DNS (Domain Name System) is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses, allowing computers to locate and connect to resources 
on the internet. The DNS record for www.foobar.com typically includes an "A record," which maps the domain name (www.foobar.com) to the corresponding 
IP address of the web server hosting the website.

--> Role of the Web Server:
The web server is a software application or a physical server responsible for serving web content to clients over the internet. It handles incoming 
HTTP requests from web browsers and delivers web pages, files, or other resources in response. The primary role of the web server is to process these 
requests, retrieve the requested content from the server's file system or database, and send it back to the client's web browser for display.

--> Role of the Application Server:
The application server is a software framework or platform that provides an environment for running and executing web applications. It typically sits 
between the web server and the database server and is responsible for processing dynamic content, executing application logic, managing sessions, and 
interacting with other backend components such as databases or external services. Application servers play a crucial role in serving dynamic web pages 
and supporting the functionality of web applications.

--> Role of the Database:
The database is a structured collection of data organized for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation. In the context of web applications, 
databases store and manage various types of data, such as user information, content, settings, and transaction records. The role of the database is to 
provide a persistent storage solution for storing and retrieving data required by the web application. It supports operations such as data querying, 
insertion, updating, and deletion, enabling the application to store and retrieve information dynamically.
