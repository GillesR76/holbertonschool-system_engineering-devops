--> Scale up with load balancers in a cluster:

Introducing additional servers and configuring load balancers in a cluster are deliberate strategies to amplify processing capabilities and system availability. 
Assigning dedicated roles to servers enables meticulous resource management and performance refinement, laying the groundwork for scalable, maintenance-efficient, 
and future-proof network architectures, ready to accommodate evolving demands and technological advancements.


--> What is a scale up (vertical scaling):

Scale up refers to increasing the capacity of a single server or resource to handle more load. This typically involves upgrading the existing hardware components of 
a server, such as CPU, RAM, or storage, to improve its performance and capacity.


--> Interest of scaling up a load balancer in a cluster:

- Increased traffic handling: allows to handle a larger volume of incoming traffic. As the load balancer is the entry point for all incoming requests, ensuring it 
has sufficient resources to handle peak traffic loads is essential for maintaining the availability and performance of the application.
- Improved performance: it can improve its processing capabilities and reduce latency in routing requests to backend servers.
- Support for advanced features: it may enable support for additional features or functionalities.
- Redundancy and high availability: in highly available architectures, load balancers are often deployed in redundant configurations to minimize downtime and ensure 
continuous availability. 
- Future growth: it prepares the infrastructure for future growth and scalability.
